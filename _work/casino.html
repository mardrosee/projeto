intro: "A look back on a product I developed in 2016 as a current Digital Experience Design student. "
description: "I learned how a website can have a system for restaurant reservations, casino information, events
schedules, ticket selling, games and all
of its documentation under the same URL adress without seeming chaotic - simplifying complexity.
Even though this proposal didnâ€™t go forward after its pitch, I personally saw its benefit as it broaden my horizons for
later adventures.
I loved having to think of a complex web product and how it would interact with itself.
Even though we developed, tried and failed, its process is something I will cherish and it certainly was a major boost
for me to be interested in this design field and wanting to learn more of it!"
